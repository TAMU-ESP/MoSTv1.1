[Overview]

This tutorial document provides a introduction to the MotionSynthesis Visualization Tool. It covers the general description and manipulation of this tool from package import, display description and function introduction.

MotionSynthesis Visualization is a Matlab-based GUI tool for motion display, observation and annotation.

[Introduction]

Tools is contained in Package 'MotionSynthesis Visualization'. The folder contains:

1\annotations folder: contains generated annotations records files;
2\html folder: contains publish information for website display;
3\input folder: contains all the input files for motion display;
4\video folder: contains subject specific folders containing related avi video files;
5\tutorial.txt
6\Visualization.m: main program

[Tutorial]

Following steps shows how to use MotionSynthesis Visualization tool:

1\Prepare the input package. Input package should contains following files:
	
  1\ Sequence file. Sequence file is a txt file which contains instructions for motion display. Sequence file contains subject's name and 'sequence' as keyword.
     In the sequence file, Four types of information is provided. First line is the information line containing trial subject's name and trial time. Second line includes all sensors what is desired to be displayed. Third line contains the keywords of input data. Fourth line is motion list including sequence of motion.
  2\ Annotations.txt. Annotations file contains boundary data between different motion.
  3\ text data. Text data files have name containing the keyword which is mentioned in sequence files. Also data specified which motes need to be shown.

2\Make sure Matlab is installed in PC. If so, open Visualization.m to open. It may take a little while to read in all video files

3\After window opens, motion data and video is shown with double triangle indicator is shown at the beginning position. Grey dotted annotations are displayed as well to separate motions apart.
